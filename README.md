# ITJuana Challenge
This is the challenge code by Jose Miguel Rodriguez Reyes
These two solutions are written in Typescript, you can transpile them into Javascript too.
You will need Node.js installed (Currently I have v16.13.2 in my workstation).
Also I used VS Code to work in the solution.
Any questions or comments you can reach me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jm970430/) or by email: jomirore@hotmail.com

## How to run
1. Install dependencies using `npm install` in a new terminal.
2. Run the project using `npm start` command, it can be in the same terminal.
3. If you prefer running Typescript transpiled code, use `npm run build` first, this will generate the ./dist directory with all transpiled .js files
4. You can modify arrays and target to test the functions.
5. To run unit test cases, use `npm test` command.
6. Enjoy!
